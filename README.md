This project utilizes Express.js along with various middleware and tools to create a robust server capable of handling file uploads and making HTTP requests to external APIs.

## Technologies Used

### 1. Express

**Express** is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies the process of building web and mobile applications. Key features include:

- **Routing**: Define different routes for handling HTTP methods and URLs.
- **Middleware**: Functions that modify request and response objects, execute code, and manage the request-response cycle.
- **HTTP Utilities**: Simplify handling requests, setting response status, headers, etc.
- **Template Engines**: Support for rendering dynamic content using engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars.

### 2. Axios

**Axios** is a promise-based HTTP client for Node.js and browsers, ideal for making HTTP requests to external APIs. Key features:

- **Promise-based**: Simplifies handling asynchronous requests.
- **Interceptors**: Intercept and handle requests or responses.
- **JSON Transformation**: Automatic transformation of response data to JSON format.
- **Error Handling**: Provides consistent error handling.
- **Request Cancellation**: Supports canceling requests using AbortController.

### 3. Multer

**Multer** is middleware for handling `multipart/form-data`, used primarily for file uploads. Features include:

- **File Storage**: Store uploaded files in memory or on disk.
- **File Filtering**: Filter files based on types or other criteria.
- **Customizable**: Configure size limits, field names, etc.
- **Form Parsing**: Parse incoming form data in Express applications.

### 4. CORS

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is middleware that enables secure cross-origin requests in Express. Features include:

- **Security**: Prevents unauthorized cross-site request forgery attacks.
- **Configuration**: Define allowed domains, HTTP methods, and headers.
- **Preflight Requests**: Browser checks before sending certain cross-origin requests.

### 5. Form-Data

**Form-Data** module creates readable `multipart/form-data` streams for sending form data, crucial for file uploads via HTTP. Features include:

- **Stream Creation**: Create readable streams for form data.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with HTTP clients like Axios.
- **File Upload Support**: Include files in form data for API requests.

## Additional Middleware and Libraries [if i will ever want to improve this]

- **Helmet**: Enhances security by setting various HTTP headers.
- **Rate Limiter**: Limits repeated requests to APIs, protecting against abuse.
- **Compression**: Reduces response size for faster transmission.
- **Morgan**: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js.
- **Dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **Express Validator**: Middleware for validating and sanitizing input data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Secure endpoints with token-based authentication.
